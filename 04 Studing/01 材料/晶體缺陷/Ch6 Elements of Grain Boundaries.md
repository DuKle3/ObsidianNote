## Grain Boundaries (arrays of dislocation)

- single crystals are lab tool
- most engineering objects are polycrystalline materials

### Grain boundary strength vs. crystal strength

- Transgranular : GB strength > crystal strength
- Intergranular : GB strength < crystal strength

- 弱的會破裂

## Dislocation Model of A Small-Angle GB

- If two grains differ only slightly in their relative orientation 
	- Small angle grain boundaries

$$sin({\theta\over 2}) = {b\over2d}$$
- $\theta$ 很小，可approximate

- **small ange GB is difficult to find in real case**

## Five Degrees of Freedom of a GB

- Symmetrical tilt boundary - 2
- Twist boundary - 1
- Asymmetrical rotaion - 2

## Stress Field of a GB

- GB don't possess long-range stress fields

## Stress field of an edge dislocation

- **only $\tau_{xy}$  有值** (很小)

> GB edge disl line 的 shear stress field
> 會小於單獨的disl line

> no effective long-range stress due to a tilt boundary

## GB (Strain) Energy

## Low-enery dislocation structures 
## LEDS

- when d decreases, $w_{gb}$ decreases
> there is a driving force that **attracts the edge dislocations into a tilt boundary**

(tilt boundary : 是一種LEDS)

- tilt boundary : having a low strain energy

- Recovery - is a process by which deformed grains can **reduce their stored energy** by the removal or rearrangement of defects in thir crystal structure

- 強度 正比於 disl density

## Dynamic Recovery (formation of LEDS)

- Static recovery (high temp)
	- require thermal energy
	- ex : annealing
- Dynamic recovery - rearragement of the dislocations
	- driving force 形成 LEDS
	- lowers the avg of strain Energy
	- 多發生於metals of **high stacking fault energy**

- more stacking fault energy 
- more dynamic recovery
- lower strain energy
> 漂亮的GB

相反 : GB看起來很亂 (disl line 沒有跑到GB)

### During plastic deformation
- more plastic deformation
- more disl density
- more \# of cell
- less cell size

- Temp 高 - dynamic recovery 多
	- 因為mobility of the disl increases

### Static vs Dynamic

- static 
	- disl movement : interaction stresses between disl 本身
	- 發生於deformation之後
- dynamic 
	- applied stresses added to the stresses acting between the disl
	- 發生在deformation當下

## Surface tension of the grain boundary

- the solid grain boundarise possess a surface tension

### Measuring the surface energy of solids
1. Fracture method
2. Indentation method

### Surface energy and temperature

- more temp
- less surface energy
> temp 越高,vibrate more , 鍵結能less

> Force balance requires : 正弦
> 大部分的是large angle --> $120^\circ$ 

### GB strengthening

1. Driving force : Temperature
2. Reducing grain boundary area 

## Boundaryies between crystals of different phases

- allotropy : for elements only - diff tmperature diff structure
- polymorphism : the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure
- solid solution

- force balance requires 
r12/r11 = 1/2cos(x/2)
x : 角度

- When 角度趨近於0
	- the 2nd phase penetrate the single phase boundary
> most harmful

## Grain Size

$$ 數目 = {\# intersections \over line length}  M$$ 
- M : 放大倍率

## The effect of GB on Mechanical properties

- grain size 越小 
- hardness 越大

## Summery
- GB as a barrier to the dislocation movement

1. for coarse-grained material
	- GB 少
	- 可容納較多disl
	- stress multiplication greater
	- 需要應力較小
2. for fine-grained material
	- GB 多
	- 可容納較少disl
	- stress multiplication smaller
	- 需要應力較大
	- hardness 硬

## Coincidence Site Boundaries

### low energy : good atomic fit

- 越多 越相似
